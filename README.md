# dotfiles

this is just a backup of my simple scripts and dotfiles. if you like them, use them as you want. they are not 
sophisticated as i can't program or configure stuff in a nice way.

# in detail
conky-i3bar does start conky with settings from .conkyrc above. personally i do like conky better than the 
default i3bar-status thingy.

flash.sh is a small script to troll people. you need to have xdotool installed and then this script will 
randomly switch workspaces on i3 with meta key as modifier.

lock.sh is a simple script to pixelize your screen when locking it.
